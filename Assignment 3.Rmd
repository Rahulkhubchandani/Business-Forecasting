# Time series dataset that I have chosen is Qauselec which was under the fpp2 library package.
#  Quarterly time series of class ts
#  The time series Qauselec from fpp2 package shows the time series values of Quarterly Australian Electricity Production. Total quarterly electricity production in Australia (in billion kWh) from 1956:Q1 to 2010:Q2. 


# The plot shows a upwards trending graph in which trend the trend increases with time.
# As per the observations from the plot. I believe the ACF Plot will have all statistically significant values, the correlation values after each lag will gradually come down.
plot(qauselec, main = "Quarterly Australian Electricity production", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Electricity Production")


# ACF is an (complete) auto-correlation function which gives us values of auto-correlation of any series with its lagged values.
# ACF describes how well the present value of the series is related with its past values. A time series can have components like trend, seasonality, cyclic and residual. ACF considers all these components while finding correlations hence it’s a ‘complete auto-correlation plot’.
# The ACF plot shows all the correlation values above major portion of the confidence level which shows that the historic data has significant impact on the preceding data.
Acf(qauselec, main = "ACF Plot - Electricity Production")


elec1 <- HoltWinters(qauselec)

# It can be observed that the Holt Winters fit is deviating at some points from the original plot which indicates that the Holt Winters forecasting might be wrong at some level as the red line is deviated from the original black point in the plot.

# The residuals seem to have an increasing trend with time,
plot(elec1_f$residuals, ylab = "Residuals")

# The histogram plot should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 to be good forecast but in our data set these conditions are not satisfied.
hist(elec1_f$residuals, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")

# The ACF Plot shows that there is a statistical significant difference which implies the plot is predictable.
Acf(elec1_f$residuals, main = "ACF of Residuals")

# The RMSE should be the least for the forecast to be good which happens to be in our case.
